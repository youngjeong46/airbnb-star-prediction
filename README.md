## Predicting Airbnb 5-Star Listings

In this project, I use classification algorithms to model the best predictor for an Airbnb listing that has a five-star ratings. 


## Project Organization 
------------
The structure of the project organization is adapted from Cliff Clive's [DataScienceMVP](https://github.com/cliffclive/datasciencemvp), which itself is adapted from the famous Data Science project structure from Cookiecutters that you can access [here](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science/).
